# 1\. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

This document describes what **StudyHub** must do. StudyHub is a web app that helps students keep their courses, deadlines and group work in one place. The document is for our team, our peer reviewers and our lecturers.

## 1.2 Scope

Group projects get chaotic: many group chats, hard-to-match schedules, notes spread over several apps. StudyHub puts it all in one place. It lets students:

- track their courses and deadlines,  
- see who is doing which task in a group,  
- see what is due next,  
- find a time when the whole group can meet,  
- keep shared notes for the group.

The use cases are shown in the [use case diagram](http://use-case-diagram.md). StudyHub is **not** a learning management system (like Moodle), has no video calls and does no grading.

## 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations

## 1.5 Overview

Section 2 describes the product in general. Section 3 lists what the system must do and the quality it must have. Section 4 holds supporting information.

# 2\. Overall Description

**Product perspective.** StudyHub is a stand-alone web application (browser front end, server back end, database). It does not depend on any university system. It sends emails through an external email service.

**Main functions.** Students can register and log in, add courses and deadlines, create study groups and invite others, assign tasks, see a dashboard of what is due, enter their availability to find meeting times, write shared notes, and get reminders by email.

**Users.** University students, comfortable with web apps, no technical training needed. Some use it daily, others only before deadlines.

**Constraints.**

- Three students build it within one semester.  
- Documentation is written in Markdown and stored in Git, separate from the code.  
- Personal data must follow the GDPR.

**Assumptions.**

- Users have a modern browser, internet access and an email address.  
- Each student has their own account; there are no shared accounts.

**Priorities.** The first release has everything marked *High*. Items marked *Medium* or *Low* come later if time allows.

# 3\. Specific Requirements

## 3.1 Functionality

### Accounts *(High)*

- A visitor can register with name, email and password and must confirm the email address.  
- A student can log in, log out and reset a forgotten password.  
- A student can edit their profile and delete their account with all their data.

### Courses and deadlines *(High)*

- A student can add, edit and delete courses.  
- A student can add, edit and delete deadlines for a course.  
- Deadlines that have passed are marked as overdue.

### Study groups *(High)*

- A student can create a study group and becomes its Group Owner.  
- A Group Owner can invite students by email or link and can remove members or delete the group.  
- An invited student can accept or decline.  
- A member can leave a group.

### Tasks *(High)*

- A group member can create a task with title, description, due date and a person responsible.  
- A task has the status *To do*, *In progress* or *Done*.  
- Members can edit, reassign and delete tasks.  
- The group can see who is doing which task.

### Dashboard *(High)*

- A student sees all upcoming deadlines and open tasks from every course and group, sorted by date.  
- Items due within 48 hours and overdue items are highlighted.  
- The list can be filtered by course or group.

### Availability and meetings *(Medium)*

- A student can enter when they are free or busy.  
- The system shows the times when all (or most) group members are free.  
- A member can create a meeting with title, time and place or link.  
- Members can accept or decline a meeting.

### Shared notes *(Medium)*

- Group members can create, edit, delete and search notes.  
- Only members of the group can see its notes.  
- Each note shows who changed it last and when.

### Notifications *(Medium)*

- Students get an email when a task is assigned to them, 24 hours before something is due, and when a meeting is created or changed.  
- Students can switch each kind of notification on or off.

### Calendar export *(Low)*

- A student can export deadlines, tasks and meetings as an iCalendar (.ics) file.

## 3.2 Usability

- A new user can register, create a group and add a first task within 5 minutes without help.  
- The interface works on desktop and on phones (from 360 px wide).  
- The interface follows WCAG 2.1 level AA (contrast, keyboard use).  
- The interface is in English; adding languages later must be possible.

## 3.3 Reliability

- The system is available at least 99 % of the time per month, not counting announced maintenance.  
- The database is backed up daily and can be restored to any day of the last 7 days.  
- If an action fails, no input is lost and the user sees a clear error message.

## 3.4 Performance

- 95 % of pages and actions respond within 2 seconds.  
- The system supports at least 500 users, 100 of them at the same time.  
- The dashboard loads within 3 seconds for a user with 20 courses and 200 tasks.

## 3.5 Supportability

- Code follows a written coding standard checked by a linter.  
- Code and documentation are in Git; documentation is in its own `docs/` folder.  
- The core functions (accounts, courses, groups, tasks, dashboard) have automated tests that run before changes are merged.

## 3.6 Design Constraints

- StudyHub is a web app for current Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge.  
- Passwords are stored only as salted hashes, and all traffic uses HTTPS.  
- Only data needed for the functions above is stored (GDPR).  
- The team works in small steps and reviews each other's changes before merging.

## 3.7 On-line User Documentation and Help System Requirements

A short getting-started guide and help texts for groups, tasks and meetings. No printed manual.

## 3.8 Purchased Components

None. We use open-source libraries and possibly the free tier of an email delivery service.

## 3.9 Interfaces

**User interfaces.** A responsive web interface with login and registration, dashboard, course view, group view (members, tasks, meetings, notes) and settings. Prototypes will be added in Section 4\.

**Hardware interfaces.** None.

**Software interfaces.** An email service (e.g. SMTP) sends confirmation, invitation and reminder emails. Calendar export uses the iCalendar format (RFC 5545).

**Communications interfaces.** Browser and server talk over HTTPS. The front end uses a REST/JSON interface to the back end.

## 3.10 Licensing Requirements

The source code gets an open-source license chosen by the team. Libraries must have compatible licenses.

## 3.11 Legal, Copyright and Other Notices

A privacy notice and terms of use are reachable from every page. Third-party copyright notices are listed where required.

## 3.12 Applicable Standards

GDPR (EU 2016/679), WCAG 2.1 level AA, RFC 5545 (iCalendar), IEEE Std 830-1998 as guidance for this document.
